# Treasure Island

## Project Introduction 
- A fun terminal game to look for the treasure.

## Skills Demonstrated
- I explored the basics of conditional statements and operators.

## Challenges Faced
- importing the art. I originally put the  `art.py` in the root folder but had a trouble importing it so I opted to move both files in the same directory.

## Learning and Growth 
- Refactored my code for the first time to practice creating functions. Also switched from camelCasing to snake_casing as per best practices.

## Conclusion
- This module was the start of using logic in designing the codes. The projects are getting more difficult but with constant practice and adhering to best practice, I should be able to keep up.
