# Band Name Generator

## Project Introduction 
- This project aims to create a band name by combining a city and pet's name.
## Skills Demonstrated
- This project showed my knowledge in the foundations of python programming, particularly in using print and input. There were a little string manipulations involved and use of variables.

## Challenges Faced
- Having learned Javascript before, I often find myself using 'var', 'let', and 'const' in using variables. It's quite a hard habit to break.

## Learning and Growth 
- This is the first project I have made using python. While using an IDE and git was not yet introduced in the course (we were using replit), I have decided to use Github as a tracker to my daily coding.

## Conclusion
- This is the first of the 100 days and 100 major projects I will be doing with Python. I am excited to grow as a programmer and hope to build a daily programming habit.
