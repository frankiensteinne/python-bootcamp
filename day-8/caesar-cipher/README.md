# Caesar Cipher

## Project Introduction 
- Create a Ceasar Cipher with game state.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Got introduced to functions with inputs. 

## Challenges Faced
- Figuring out how to execute the game state. I have done a lot of trial and errors before finding which line to call the caesar function.

## Learning and Growth 
- Read the error message and use the built-in debugging tools. I've learned to utilize stackoverflow and ask good questions.

## Conclusion
- I need to step a pedestal down and use print to debug my code. Also, check for correct indentation, python is very particular about it.
