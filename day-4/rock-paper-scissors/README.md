# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Introduction 
- The objective of this activity is to create a rock-paper-scissors terminal game.

## Skills Demonstrated
- This activity used a certain level of understanding to basic debugging, use of the Random modules, and an introduction to lists.

## Challenges Faced
- The debugging was quite difficult as you have to be prepared for the different inputs. It was also a challenge to make the game dynamic so I abandoned that idea (for now).

## Learning and Growth 
- As this needed a bit of logic to execute, my python logical operators was also practiced and reinforced. I also tried my best to write as little lines of code as possible and I think I was able to achieve that.

## Conclusion
- The Rock-Paper-Scissors is always a food activity to practice the level of knowledge in understanding basic programming principle. I hope to be able to make a redux version of this that is more complex and cleaner.
