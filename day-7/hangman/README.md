# Hangman

## Project Introduction 
- The Hangman project is a culmination of the fundamentals of Python. From using lists, debugging, and use of control operators.

## Skills Demonstrated
- For this project, Angela broke down the process into parts. Because of these parts, I am able to see the difference of her code to mine as well as my thinking process.

## Challenges Faced
- I find indenting difficult. There were times when I can't figure out my error only to realize after a while that i have indented my code wrong.

## Learning and Growth 
- I By breaking down the project into phases, I am able to see how my thinking process works. By understanding it, I can identify my gaps and work on them.

## Conclusion
- This was a fun project. I see myself doing a redux of this game when to include game states and difficulties.
