# Password Generator

## Project Introduction 
- Create a random password generator based on the inputs of the user.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Learned how to refactor a python code. I was able to see a version that would turn my 3 lines of code into 1. I retained one of them to my original ode to have a baseline of comparison. I was able to use the for loop and continued practicing commenting on my codes.

## Challenges Faced
- My biggest chellenge was the urge to jump to stackoverflow instead of reading the documentations. I feel like using stackoverflow is the easy way out of a problem.

## Learning and Growth 
- I feel like I am getting the hang of python syntax now. I rarely have the urge to use `{}` and `;` in my code. 

## Conclusion
- The exercises for this lessons are a throwback from my Javascript learning days. The logical thinking remains the same, only the  syntax differs. I learn the syntax as I go, but the computing thinking I have to practice regularly.
