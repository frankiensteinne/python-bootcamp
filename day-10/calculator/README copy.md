# Calculator

## Project Introduction 
- Create a simple calculator

## Skills Demonstrated
- Deep dived into using dictionaries as data structure.

## Challenges Faced
- Recursions and figuring out which should be functions and which can be just lines of code.

## Learning and Growth 
- Explored more on returns. I have already noted which parts of the calculator I can enhance in the future.

## Conclusion
- This was a fun activity but rather complex. I used everything I learned in this project such as using different types of functions, use of dictionary, and loops.
