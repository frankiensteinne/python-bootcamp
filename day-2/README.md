# Tip Calculator
## Project Introduction 
- The objective of this project is to create an app that would automatically compute how much each person in a party would play with tip.

## Skills Demonstrated
- WThis project showed my knowledge in the foundations of python programming, particularly in understanding the different data types. 

## Challenges Faced
- Mixing up `int` and `float`. In Javascript, there were only 3 data types, `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. In Python number is split into `integer` and `float`.

## Learning and Growth 
- Started to use/ create diagrams to visualize a workflow.

## Conclusion
- Excited with the capabilities of Python,with the introduction of mathematical operations, I am know more energized to learn as these are the foundations I need for when I specialize on Business Analysis and NLP.
