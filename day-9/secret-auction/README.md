# Secret Auction

## Project Introduction 
- Create a secret auction with dictionaries

## Skills Demonstrated
- Use of dictionaries in storing data and use of state to add new bidders.

## Challenges Faced
- Figuring out how which should be under the State Loop and what can be done as functions. Playing around import os and clearing the terminal.

## Learning and Growth 
- Use flowcharts as a visual tool. This can also help visualize where and what to put in the loop.

## Conclusion
- Cleaning code can be quite difficult. Using print to check data is a good debugging tool but can make the codes long.
